    <h1>GROUP WORK</h1>
    <H2>Benefits of working in a group </H2>
    <p>It can be easier to motivate yourself for the course when working in small groups. To know that the work you put in affects everyone in the group can increase quality and productivity because you feel a responsibility. 
        The influence of other people could inspire by their knowledge and passion of the course. Having motivated group members spreads positivity through the group. Furthermore, group work can result in long lasting friendships. Having a healthy social life is important both to perform in the course, but also to live a happy and fulfilling life in general.

    <h2>Disadvantage of working in groups </h2>
    <p>
        It’s hard to find time that everyone can meet to discuss the assignment, because we all have our own stuff to do, like work, family, etc. This can make it hard to finish the work on time. And the other reason is that it can be hard for someone to work with strangers. The reason can be that they are shy and are afraid to show their opinion in front of strangers.
        And when we work in small groups it can be hard to be agree about the stuff we are going to work with and what we are going to write about.
