            <p>I attended Hvam VGS in Nes. It is an agriculture school with many different animals.</p>
        <h1>7439</h1>
            <p>My vgs was like the ship of Theseus;
                got to attend the same vgs as 2 different buildings.
            </p>        
        <h1>6627</h1>
            <p>My vgs was able generate its own electricity using geothermal energy. The school would sell
                 the excess amount of electricity in holidays. I think that's pretty cool</p>

            <p>The vgs i attended was the biggest vgs in Oslo, it almost looked like a shopping mall!
                The canteen here had good food but i still prefered homemade lunch. </p>
